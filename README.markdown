# Invisible Thief

## A Whitespace implementation in Racket

### Why?

Because why not? [Whitespace][1] is a cute idea, and the [Racket][2] folks like
to advertise their language as a little language laboratory, as well as tauting
the power of macros.

Inspired by Danny Yoo's [F\*dging up a Racket][3] and Greg Hendershott's 
[Fear of Macros][4], I thought I'd give it a go.
